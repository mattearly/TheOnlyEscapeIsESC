#### what is this?

A game I made for a class to demonstrate some stuff you can do with OpenGL, C++, and SDL2 libraries.

#### how to win the game:

* escape the house

#### controls:

* mouse move - look
* wasd - move
* space - jump
* mouse wheel - zoom in/out
* e and/or left click - interact/use
* ESC - win the game by giving up like a sissy

#### requirements to compile with debian (built on Linux Mint, these instructions should work with any Debian based distro)

* glut

      apt install freeglut3-dev

* glew

      apt install libglew-dev 

* opengl32 - usually comes with your graphics card drivers

* sdl2-mixer

      apt install libsdl2-mixer-dev

* glm

      apt install libglm-dev

---

#### compile

* clone this repo
* `cd` to directory

      make
      make run

* if it fails, address requirements/dependencies and try again
